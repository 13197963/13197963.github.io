Group Activities 2

1a)

informal/incidental - People learn in order to complete tasks and projects that they have been assigned, rather than with the direct intent ot learn
experimental - People in a workplace learn by doing, and by seeing what ideas do and do not work.
context bound - People learn by their context, i.e. by what the people around them know and understand, as it is their interactions with others knowledge and ideas that helps to shape their own understanding of different concepts. Organisational goals and structure also influence this, as different groups within the workplace may be aiming to interpret the results from ideas and experiments in their own way (i.e. salemen looking for a point that is potentially sellable).

Another main way that people learn in the workplace, is from 'sink or swim' style events where they are dropped into the deep end on a existing project, where they are expected to learn the minutiae of a system very quickly in order to fill their role within the project.
It is also possible for people to learn through their interactions outside the workplace, such as if they have a personal interest in things similar to that which they are working on duing work hours (i.e. a telecommunication engineer having an interest in remote control helicopters).
A more rigid form of learning in the workplace is through extra training, whether that be from returning to tertiary education, or be from reciving competency from an RTO.
