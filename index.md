# About Me

Hi, I'm Daniel a second year Engineer majoring in Data Engineering.
The first question I always get when I tell people I'm doing Data Engineering is what is Data Engineering?
At its core Data Engineering is the study of collection of data, data transmission and storage, and the manipulation and understanding of data.
I normally then get asked, what does that actually mean though?
I make the programs that create and collect data from the world around us.
I make the software and networks that send and store that data.
I do the analysis to find trends and correlations within the data.
