### Advertisment One: Star Entertainment Group
Star Entertainment Group is the casino, hotel, and events side of the now demerged Tabcorp Group. They are most well known for their operation of The Star Casino in Pyrmont.

Star Entertainment Group employs software and cybersecurity engineers in their cybersecurity division, which aims to help prevent the unauthorised access of their confidential client information.

This is the type of work I would be interested in due to my interest in cybersecurity, as a place such as a hotel and casino is extremely likely to come under cyber attack, and is also able to afford the latest technology in terms of their cyber security systems.

Applications for the Cyber Security Internship are done through Star Entertainment Group's website

### Advertisment Two: IBM Australia
IBM is a multinational technology company offering infrastructure, software, and cloud compute solutions.

Recent projects in Australia include the migration of Mitsubishi Motors Australia to IBM Cloud. This use of IBM's cloud services allowed for higher uptime, as well as increasing scalability due to the system being hosted in the cloud.

This is the type of work I would be interested in due to my prior experience with cloud (AWS) and SaaS (SAP) systems, as well as the physical infrastructure and networks that allow these systems to function and maintain their high uptime.

Applications for the IBM internship program are done through both indeed and IBM's own website.

### Advertisment Three: Cisco Meraki
Cisco Meraki is a multinational technology company specialising in networking/telecommunications.

Recent large scale projects that Cisco Australia has worked on include network infrastructure for Optus' Commonwealth Games Digital Platform. However Cisco also supplies infrastructure and technologies to small and large businesses across Australia.

This is the sort of work I would be interested in due to my personal interest in networking. I also believe that working at a multinational such as Cisco Meraki would be interesting as there is the potential for working alongside overseas teams, bringing in people with vearied backgrounds.

Due to Cisco Meraki being a large company, the majority of recruitment is done through their HR department and [Jobs Portal](https://jobs.cisco.com/), although there is a potential employee social network/messageboard in the form of the [We Are Cisco Blog](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/careers/we-are-cisco/social-and-blog.html).
Cisco Meraki has advertised current internships on [UTS CareerHub](https://careerhub.uts.edu.au/students/jobs/detail/4657200/network-support-engineer-inter), which are approved by FEIT.
