### Advertisment One: Cisco Meraki
Cisco Meraki is a multinational technology company specialising in networking/telecommunications.

Recent large scale projects that Cisco Australia has worked on include network infrastructure for Optus' Commonwealth Games Digital Platform. However Cisco also supplies infrastructure and technologies to small and large businesses across Australia.

This is the sort of work I would be interested in due to my personal interest in networking. I also believe that working at a multinational such as Cisco Meraki would be interesting as there is the potential for working alongside overseas teams, bringing in people with vearied backgrounds.

Due to Cisco Meraki being a large company, the majority of recruitment is done through their HR department and [Jobs Portal](https://jobs.cisco.com/), although there is a potential employee social network/messageboard in the form of the [We Are Cisco Blog](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/careers/we-are-cisco/social-and-blog.html).
Cisco Meraki has advertised current internships on [UTS CareerHub](https://careerhub.uts.edu.au/students/jobs/detail/4657200/network-support-engineer-inter), which are approved by FEIT.

### Advertisment Two: IBM Australia
IBM is a multinational technology company offering infrastructure, software, and cloud compute solutions.

Recent projects in Australia include the migration of Mitsubishi Motors Australia to IBM Cloud. This use of IBM's cloud services allowed for higher uptime, as well as increasing scalability due to the system being hosted in the cloud.

This is the type of work I would be interested in due to my prior experience with cloud (AWS) and SaaS (SAP) systems, as well as the physical infrastructure and networks that allow these systems to function and maintain their high uptime.

Applications for the IBM internship program are done through both indeed and IBM's own website.

### Advertisment Three: Google Australia
Google is a multinational technologie company specialising in scalable business tools, SEO, data storage, and data analytics.

Google is responsible for some of the most accessed sites on the internet, such as Gmail, Google Search, and Youtube. Google for Business also offer scalable systems that work with everything from small businesses to organisations with hundreds of thousands of employees.

I feel this would be a worthwhile opportunity as Google's significant resources allow them to use cutting edge hardware and technology, whilst still being able to maintain the agility of smaller businesses.

Due to Google's size, recruitment is managed by their internal HR department and external recruiters. Job postings and vacancies can also be found on websites such as [Indeed](https://au.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=29e1170cd24c765d&tk=1d2gck83510ad003&from=serp&vjs=3).
