Engineering Identity is developed through three core events in a feedback loop; The development of engineering skills, recognition of self, and recognition of others (Schell and Hughes, 2017). Although "Engineering Skills" are most commonly assumed to be technical skills, there is a significant social component, as engineers must be able to communicate their ideas with people of varying technical background, as well as those with non-technical backgrounds.
Developing a leadership identity is also important in the development of an engineering identity, as part of an engineers role within projects and society is to assist in the planning and management of tasks. However according to Schell and Hughes 2017, this is a skill that is quite often overlooked or not included within traditional engineering education programmes.
It is still however possible to learn and develop a leadership identity and thus an engineering identity within the tertiary education environment. Technical skills are easily learned through the completeion of classes, however by participating in group assignments and projects student engineers are able to understand tasks and phenomena such as delegation of roles and team dynamics. Additional communication skills can be learnt through student engineers participating in the greater university community, such as by joining societies. This allows students to communicate their ideas and knowledge with those of different background (especially non-technical), which is something that may not occur during the process of normal group assignments

## Job Market Analysis



### Advertisment One: Cisco Meraki
Cisco Meraki is a multinational technology company specialising in networking/telecommunications.

Recent large scale projects that Cisco Australia has worked on include network infrastructure for Optus' Commonwealth Games Digital Platform. However Cisco also supplies infrastructure and technologies to small and large businesses across Australia.

This is the sort of work I would be interested in due to my personal interest in networking. I also believe that working at a multinational such as Cisco Meraki would be interesting as there is the potential for working alongside overseas teams, bringing in people with vearied backgrounds.

Due to Cisco Meraki being a large company, the majority of recruitment is done through their HR department and [Jobs Portal](https://jobs.cisco.com/), although there is a potential employee social network/messageboard in the form of the [We Are Cisco Blog](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/careers/we-are-cisco/social-and-blog.html).
Cisco Meraki has advertised current internships on [UTS CareerHub](https://careerhub.uts.edu.au/students/jobs/detail/4657200/network-support-engineer-inter), which are approved by FEIT.

### Advertisment Two: Google Australia
Google is a multinational technologie company specialising in scalable business tools, SEO, data storage, and data analytics.

Google is responsible for some of the most accessed sites on the internet, such as Gmail, Google Search, and Youtube. Google for Business also offer scalable systems that work with everything from small businesses to organisations with hundreds of thousands of employees.

I feel this would be a worthwhile opportunity as Google's significant resources allow them to use cutting edge hardware and technology, whilst still being able to maintain the agility of smaller businesses.

Due to Google's size, recruitment is managed by their internal HR department and external recruiters. Job postings and vacancies can also be found on websites such as [Indeed](https://au.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=29e1170cd24c765d&tk=1d2gck83510ad003&from=serp&vjs=3).
