## Careers Fair
In order to learn more about the career paths available to me I attended one of the STEM Careers Fairs organised by UTS Careers in Building 1.
As this event was more focused on pathways for students nearing graduation, I used it as a way to find out what companies were employing young engineers, as well as what sort of engineers they were looking to employ (in terms of technical background, as well as experience and personality).

I also collected some information booklets and brochures from the businesses attending, however very few of the companies were looking for my skillset, and even fewer still were looking to talk to someone with so many years left in their degree (one of the representatives literally tutted at me and proceeded to ignore me).

Although I was unsuccessful in finding any industry contacts, I still found the event useful as it helped me to find out what positions existed within the industry, and the types of companies that were hiring. it also gave me insight into the sorts of tasks that engineers perform as part of their roles, such as System Admins deploying virtual machines for their clients.

Comment on social media:
Although social media is prevalent throughout the industry, and has its place in networking with contacts and potential employers, there is a risk associated with putting yourself out there. This can include disqualification form job applications due to offensive or inappropriate posts, coworkers finding information you would prefer to keep secret, or your boss seeing every time you've complained about them or your job. Social media is a powerful tool if used correctly, however care and consideration must be taken in choosing what you post, and who can see what you post.

## Elective Journal Entries

### Entry 1

Week one was spent familiarising myself with the subject and what is expected throughout. It also included learning about the other members of my activity group, which I feel is important as it is our group members who will be giving feedback and constructive criticism on our resumes before assessments, and as such understanding their background and what they expect to get out of the subject is important as it shapes what responses they will give you on your work. Additionally it allows you to shape any feedback you have to give to them, in order for it to not be taken in the wrong way. I found the idea of the different types of capital to be interesting as the majority of people tend to think about what they believe they are worth, and what a company or job can do for them. While this is important, what you bring to the company and what the company believes you are worth are more important (human capital), as the company is the one who gets to decide who is hired and who is not. An individual must use their access to the other types of capital to help improve their percieved worth to a company (i.e. cultural capital can be slightly improved through the way that you dress, carry yourself, and interact with others), or to help gain opportunities that they may not have otherwise (i.e. social capital and your professional and personal networks can be used to find out about roles that may not be promoted as being vacant or hiring).

These different types of capital all play into the development of an "engineering identity", falling under the umbrella of "navigating the formal and informal pathways into the profession", as described in Schell, W. & Hughes, B. 2017. This does however show that while the different types of capital are important to an engineer's career, especially in terms of finding employment, they are not the be all and end all of an engineer's personal development. An engineer should aim to be continually developing not just their capital, but their engineering identity as a whole, whether that be from learning new things, learning about opportunities within the field, or by gaining recognition from their peers.





### Entry 2

No lecture this week due to Australia Day.
The majority of this week was spent working on resume writing, and getting my resume through the "rate my resume" system. The main thing I took away from this, is that although terms like "assisted" may help to give an accurate representation of what you did in a role, they appear weak or as if you were not the one doing the actual work. Instead you're better off stating the things you were directly responsible for, and using more active "strong" phrases, such as led, created, and developed.

I additionally had a lot of difficulty with the automatic grading system, in that it was saying there were differences between the formatting of paragraphs, when the paragraphs were completely identical. This was solved by rephrasing how date information was stated in the document, as as best I could tell, the system was throwing a false negative.






## Job Market Analysis



### Advertisment One: Cisco Meraki
Cisco Meraki is a multinational technology company specialising in networking/telecommunications.

Recent large scale projects that Cisco Australia has worked on include network infrastructure for Optus' Commonwealth Games Digital Platform. However Cisco also supplies infrastructure and technologies to small and large businesses across Australia.

This is the sort of work I would be interested in due to my personal interest in networking. I also believe that working at a multinational such as Cisco Meraki would be interesting as there is the potential for working alongside overseas teams, bringing in people with vearied backgrounds.

Due to Cisco Meraki being a large company, the majority of recruitment is done through their HR department and [Jobs Portal](https://jobs.cisco.com/), although there is a potential employee social network/messageboard in the form of the [We Are Cisco Blog](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/careers/we-are-cisco/social-and-blog.html).
Cisco Meraki has advertised current internships on [UTS CareerHub](https://careerhub.uts.edu.au/students/jobs/detail/4657200/network-support-engineer-inter), which are approved by FEIT.

### Advertisment Two: Google Australia
Google is a multinational technologie company specialising in scalable business tools, SEO, data storage, and data analytics.

Google is responsible for some of the most accessed sites on the internet, such as Gmail, Google Search, and Youtube. Google for Business also offer scalable systems that work with everything from small businesses to organisations with hundreds of thousands of employees.

I feel this would be a worthwhile opportunity as Google's significant resources allow them to use cutting edge hardware and technology, whilst still being able to maintain the agility of smaller businesses.

Due to Google's size, recruitment is managed by their internal HR department and external recruiters. Job postings and vacancies can also be found on websites such as [Indeed](https://au.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=29e1170cd24c765d&tk=1d2gck83510ad003&from=serp&vjs=3).
