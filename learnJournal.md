## Job Market Analysis



### Advertisment One: Cisco Meraki
Cisco Meraki is a multinational technology company specialising in networking/telecommunications.
Recent large scale projects that Cisco Australia has worked on include network infrastructure for Optus' Commonwealth Games Digital Platform. However Cisco also supplies infrastructure and technologies to small and large businesses across Australia.
This is the sort of work I would be interested in due to my personal interest in networking. I also believe that working at a multinational such as Cisco Meraki would be interesting as there is the potential for working alongside overseas teams, bringing in people with vearied backgrounds.
Due to Cisco Meraki being a large company, the majority of recruitment is done through their HR department and [Jobs Portal](https://jobs.cisco.com/), although there is a potential employee social network/messageboard in the form of the [We Are Cisco Blog](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/careers/we-are-cisco/social-and-blog.html).
Cisco Meraki has advertised current internships on [UTS CareerHub](https://careerhub.uts.edu.au/students/jobs/detail/4657200/network-support-engineer-inter), which are approved by FEIT.
